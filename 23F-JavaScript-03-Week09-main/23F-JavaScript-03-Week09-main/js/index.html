   Create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object
   Consider that a hamburger has many options – that might include
   different types of buns,
   vegetable garnishes, 
   assortments of cheeses, 
   specialty sauces, 
   different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian), 
   single, double, or triple patty, 
   Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.
   add some extra if you want
   Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too
